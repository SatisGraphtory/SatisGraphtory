      <Typography variant="h5">Saving</Typography>
      <Typography variant="body1">
        By default, the app will save files to your local browser, and NO data
        will be saved to the cloud. You have the ability to create and save
        multiple graphs locally. If you wish to utilize cloud saving, you will
        need a <b>Google</b> account in order to utilize <b>Google Drive</b> as
        a backup solution.
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body1">
        If using the cloud features, you will need to upload your local copy
        manually initially. Afterwards, you will need to periodically push your
        changes back to the cloud.

      <Typography variant="h5">Sharing</Typography>
      <Typography variant="body1">
        You <b>MUST</b> be signed into <b>Google</b> in order to create a
        sharing link. Once signed in, you must set the current file to{' '}
        <b>Shareable</b> in order to get a shareable link. By default, graphs
        will be private - only you will be able to see and edit graphs in your
        account.
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body1">
        You can still use the <b>Export to file</b> function and share that
        file, utilizing the <b>Import from file</b> feature in order to load it
        back into the app.
